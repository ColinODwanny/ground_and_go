# Ground & Go

Welcome to the **Ground & Go** repository.

This project is a cross-platform fitness and mental wellness application built with **.NET MAUI**. The app is designed to help users connect their emotional state to their physical activity by providing a flow that includes mood check-ins, journaling, and tailored mindfulness exercises before generating a workout or logging a rest day.

The application uses **Supabase** for its backend database services, handling everything from user data to workout and journal entry storage.
